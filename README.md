# Flutter Bluetooth Project with Arduino UNO and HM10
This Flutter project is designed to communicate with an Arduino UNO board via Bluetooth using the HM10 module. The project is intended to serve as a starting point for developers looking to build their own Bluetooth-based projects.

## Getting Started
To get started with this project, you will need to have the following:

Flutter SDK installed on your machine
Android Studio or any other preferred IDE
Arduino UNO board
HM10 module
Android or iOS device with Bluetooth capability
Setting up the Hardware
Connect the HM10 module to the Arduino UNO board using the following pins:

HM10 VCC to Arduino 5V
HM10 GND to Arduino GND
HM10 RX to Arduino TX
HM10 TX to Arduino RX
Connect the Arduino UNO board to your computer via USB.

Setting up the Software
Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/flutter-arduino-bluetooth.git
Open the project in Android Studio or any other preferred IDE.

Install the required dependencies by running the following command:

arduino
Copy code
flutter pub get
Modify the Bluetooth connection settings in the main.dart file to match your HM10 module settings:

java
Copy code
final BluetoothConnection connection = await BluetoothConnection.toAddress("00:21:13:03:32:26"); // Replace with your HM10 module address
Upload the Bluetooth.ino sketch to the Arduino UNO board using the Arduino IDE.

Run the application on your Android or iOS device.

Testing the Project
Open the application on your device and press the Connect button to establish a Bluetooth connection with the Arduino UNO board.

Once the connection is established, press the Send button to send a message to the Arduino UNO board.

The Arduino UNO board should receive the message and respond with a message of its own, which will be displayed in the application.

Conclusion
This project provides a basic template for building Bluetooth-based projects using Flutter and an Arduino UNO board. Developers can modify the project to suit their needs, adding additional functionality as required.
